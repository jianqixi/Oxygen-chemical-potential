# Oxygen-chemical-potential
As a function of temperature and oxygen partial pressure
This is a python code to determine the oxygen chemical potential as a function of temperature and partial pressure
The code is based on "Strain effects on oxygen vacancy energetics in KTaO3" 
If you decide to use this code or results, please cite above reference. Thanks!
